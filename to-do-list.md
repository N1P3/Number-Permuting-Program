# To Do List:

1. generator.c printing output to a separate file.
2. Completing and finally commiting perm_processing.c
3. bash_script1.sh doing revision of the output file from perm_processing.c subprogram in order to make it compatible with LaTeX's syntax.

After that:
-Meeting of the project group to check everything and decide what's next (whether we will still edit/add something or just finish it).


(This file will be regularly edited if needed)
