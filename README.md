# perm

Sketch of way how the program works:

1. User enters desired permutations to generate to user_input.txt in the following (command) format:
   - "x" Number of permutations to generate.
   - "n A" (All permutations of length equal to n (max 8))
   - "n m" (m random permutations of length equal to n).
   - ! "x" command must be entered in the first line of user_input.txt file !
   - ! Every command input must be split by newline character (i.e: "enter") !
   - ! Although last line must not be ended with enter character !
2. perm.sh starts and user_input.txt is passed to it.
3. Subprogram generator (Olek and Pawe≈Ç) generates permutations.
4. Output from generator is passed to another subprogram perm_processing (Jakub M).
5. Subprogram perm_processing processes permutations to extract additional paramaters of these permutations and prepares draft version of the final ".tex" file to output (result.tex).
6. result.tex is passed to perm.sh.
7. perm.sh finally processes result.tex to be appropriate for LaTeX.
8. result.pdf file is created.

note: user takes resposibility of erroneous program results due to invalid input.
